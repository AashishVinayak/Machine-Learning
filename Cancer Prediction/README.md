# Breast Cancer Prediction

In this notebook, I am using Wisconcsin cancer dataset to predict the possibility of cancer based on 30 features. The idea that works here is using a linear activation hidden layer of just 5 neurons on the overall standard approach of logistic regression.

This helps in bringing down the dimensionality of those 30 features to just 5 that hold the information, these 5 neurons are further mapped to a single output unit with sigmoid activation.
