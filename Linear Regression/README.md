# Linear Regression

 I have used least squares regression to predict the fuel consumption in miles per gallon given the acceleration and weight of the vehicle. Also Iâ€™ve made a comparison between linear and polynomial regression by regressing mileage on acceleration and weight using a logarithmic equation. The model may not be a perfect fit, therefore, Suggestions are welcome.
